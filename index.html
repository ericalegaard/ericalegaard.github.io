        <p>I was born in Wynnewood, PA, a suburb of Philadelphia, in May of 2001.
            <br> I am currently a freshman at Syracuse University studying Photography and Information Management & Technology.
            <br> I am a huge Philadelphia Flyers fan, so Gritty is my favorite orange mascot (Sorry, Otto!)
